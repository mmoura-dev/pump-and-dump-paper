O livro apresenta o tema "metodologia da pesquisa de forma agradável, fundamentada e baseando-se sempre em histórias ilustrativas sobre como fazer e também como não fazer um trabalho terminal de curso de computação. A ênfase principal do livro está na caracterização do trabalho científico em ciência da computação, visto que a experiência do autor em bancas examinadoras e na avaliação de artigos científicos demonstra a dificuldade que muitos alunos de computação têm em compreender e aplicar a metodologia científica a seus trabalhos.},

abstract = {A decade after the launch of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies are maturing from a niche phenomenon and appealing to a broader audience. However, the actual prevalence of cryptocurrency ownership and usage, the users’ socio-demographics, the motives to buy, and the popularity of and knowledge about cryptocurrencies have not been sufficiently researched. Based on a representative online survey among 3864 Germans, we find that 83% of the respondents are aware of the phenomenon, yet the respondents’ self-assessed knowledge about cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology is limited. 9.2% of the respondents owned cryptocurrencies at the time of the survey; another 9.1% have owned cryptocurrencies in the past. Cryptocurrency users tend to be young, male, well-educated and well-off. Ownership is often associated with long-term investments, and 62% of the respondents state that their ownership is ideologically motivated. The empirical analysis discloses that a major driver of ownership is knowledge about cryptocurrencies, mediated by trust. There is some discrepancy between the actual and perceived usage domains of cryptocurrencies, which reflects the polarization of the phenomenon. The findings have implications for regulators and businesses which are potentially affected by the increasing societal relevance of cryptocurrency.}

  abstract = {Cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, Ethereum, and, more recently, Monero has become the currency of choice for many drug dealers and extortionists. The criminal activities extend to tax evasion, money laundering, Ponzi schemes, and the theft of cryptocurrencies to kidnapping for ransom. As the demand for cryptocurrencies increases, it provides opportunities for criminals to hide behind the presumed privacy and anonymity. Identifying these cryptocurrency-related crimes have posed challenges for law enforcement due to the cross-border nature of transactions, the use of evasion technology to mask the identity of users, and inconsistent regulations. To address the role of cryptocurrencies in criminal activities, the study focused on four research questions: (1) What role do cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) play in criminal activities? (2) What factors facilitate cryptocurrency-related criminal activities? (3) What role do politics play in regulating cryptocurrencies? and (4) What are the challenges they pose for regulators and law enforcement? To answer the questions, the study utilized a systematic content review of the news reports, court cases, scholarly articles, online search engines, and commentaries relevant to regulations and reforms. The findings help to understand the current climate of virtual currencies, their use in criminal activities, and the complexities involved in regulating cryptocurrencies. }
